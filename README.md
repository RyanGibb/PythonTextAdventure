# PythonTextAdventure
A bare bones text adventure I created in python to test out some of the feature of the language I'd been learning. Has a lot of potential for expandability but has little implemented.

Warning: a lot of unimplimented features, bugs, commented out code, and little internal commentary, as this project was mainly for leaning features of the language.
